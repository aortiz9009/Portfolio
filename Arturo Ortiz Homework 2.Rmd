## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Problem 1 #

### A ###

Expected value is 33.75 and Standard deviation is 4.308

n = 75
p = 0.45
x = 75

expectedvalue = n*p
standarddeviation = sqrt(n*p*(1-p))

expectedvalue
standarddeviation

### B ###

All possible values of X.

dbinom(c(0:75),75,0.45)

### C ###

If the true effetiveness of the drug is truly 45% and the probablility of such finding in the trial, with the assumption that the true effectiveness of the drug is 45%.

sd = sqrt(.45*.55/75)

sd

P = ((0.3-0.45)/sd)

P

### D ###

The Mean is 33.7641 and the Standard Deviation is 4.340592. 

x = rbinom(10000, 75, 0.45)
mean(x)
sd(x)

The results are very close to the results in part A. They would be different based on sampling errors. 



# Problem 2 #

### A ###

The expected value is 600 and the standard deviation is 24.4949. 

lambda = 600

expected_value = lambda

standard_deviation = sqrt(lambda)

expected_value
standard_deviation

### B ###

Possibility of all possible values of X graphically and the collective probability of each grouping of 100. 

x = 0:600
lambda = 600

x = 0:600
prob = dpois(x, lambda)

plot(x, prob, type = "h", main = "Poisson Distribution", xlab = "Number of Patrons", ylab = "Probability")

group_probabilities = sapply(seq(0, 900, by = 100), function(a) sum(dpois(a:(a + 99), lambda)))
group_probabilities

### C ###

The probablility is 0.0012

prob_more_than_675 = 1 - ppois(675, lambda)
prob_more_than_675

### D ###

Both probabilities of B and D are similar. This means that the simulation in D aligns with the Poisson distribution. 

simulated_patrons = rbinom(365, size = 600, prob = lambda/600)

hist(simulated_patrons, main = "Simulated Workload", xlab = "Number of Patrons", ylab = "Frequency", breaks = seq(0, 600, by = 100))










# Problem 3 #

### A ###

Yes, this does look normally distributed. The shape of the histogram indicates that it is normally distributed. 

insurance <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EricBrownTTU/ISQS5346/main/insurance.csv")

hist(insurance$bmi, main = "BMI Histogram", xlab = "BMI", ylab = "Frequency")

### B ###

mean_bmi <- mean(insurance$bmi)
sd_bmi <- sd(insurance$bmi)
n <- length(insurance$bmi)
set.seed(123)
simulated_bmi <- replicate(5, rnorm(n, mean_bmi, sd_bmi))

### C ###

par(mfrow = c(2, 3))
hist(insurance$bmi, main = "Actual BMI Data", xlab = "BMI", ylab = "Frequency")
for (i in 1:5) {
  hist(simulated_bmi[, i], main = paste("Simulated BMI Data", i), xlab = "BMI", ylab = "Frequency")
}







### D ###

The points on the plot closely follow the straight line. This indicates that the BMI data is within a normal distribution. 

qqnorm(insurance$bmi, main = "QQ Plot of BMI Data")
qqline(insurance$bmi)


### E ###
