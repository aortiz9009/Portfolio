## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Problem 1 #

## A. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the population proportion of all auto injury ##
## files that have exaggerated loss amounts. ##


data <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EricBrownTTU/ISQS5346/main/InsuranceClaims.csv")


sample_proportion <- mean(data$Buildup)


n <- length(data$Buildup)


standard_error <- sqrt((sample_proportion * (1 - sample_proportion)) / n)


margin_of_error <- 1.96 * standard_error


confidence_interval <- c(sample_proportion - margin_of_error, sample_proportion + margin_of_error)

confidence_interval






## B. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the population mean excess payment ##
## amount. ##

sample_mean <- mean(data$ExcessPayment)


sample_std <- sd(data$ExcessPayment)


standard_error_mean <- sample_std / sqrt(n)


margin_of_error_mean <- 1.96 * standard_error_mean

## C. The insurance company estimates that the proportion of Buildup is 0.75 and the
## average excess payment is 400 Using only the confidence intervals developed in ##
## parts (a) and (b), assess the companies claims.##

if (estimated_proportion >= confidence_interval[1] && estimated_proportion <= confidence_interval[2]) {
  cat("The estimated proportion of buildup (0.75) falls within the confidence interval.")
} else {
  cat("The estimated proportion of buildup (0.75) does not fall within the confidence interval.")
